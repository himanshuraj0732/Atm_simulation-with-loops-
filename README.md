## üìÅ Code Preview

```python
balance = 90000

while True:
    print("\nWelcome to the ATM üí≥")
    print("1. Check Balance")
    print("2. Deposit")
    print("3. Withdraw")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

    if choice == "1":
        print(f"Your balance is ${balance:,.2f}")

    elif choice == "2":
        deposit = int(input("Enter the amount to deposit: "))
        balance += deposit
        print(f"You deposited ${deposit:,.2f}. New balance: ${balance:,.2f}")

    elif choice == "3":
        withdraw = int(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
        if withdraw > balance:
            print("‚ùå Insufficient balance.")
        else:
            balance -= withdraw
            print(f"You withdrew ${withdraw:,.2f}. Remaining balance: ${balance:,.2f}")

    elif choice == "4":
        print("Thank you for using our ATM. Goodbye!")
        break

    else:
        print("‚ùó Invalid choice. Please select from 1 to 4.")
